Homepage: https://turquoise-rook.cloudvent.net/<br>
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/CloudCannon/fur-jekyll-template

## Getting Started

You can [download the files from GitHub](https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-cart/archive/master.zip) (or clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-cart.git`) and have a fully functioning Jekyll site with shopping cart in minutes.

### Develop

Jekyll Cart was built with Jekyll v3.4.3, but should support newer versions also.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

```shell
$ bundle install
```

A gulp file and package.json has been included if you'd rather run Browser Sync. If not, you can run Jekyll with it's built-in serve commands

```shell
$ jekyll serve
```

Alghouth running `jekyll` commands through Bundler will ensure you're using the right versions:

```shell
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Editing

Jekyll Cart was optimized for CloudCannon but will run without it. If you plan to use the email checkout feature but aren't hosted with CloudCannon, you'll need some form system to do the sending. [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) is a good option.
