# Influencer Hugo

The **Influencer Hugo** template provides a quick option to create an e-commerce website based on the Hugo framework. Even when the theme is designed for book authors and writers, it can be customized to showcase any type of product.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy an e-commerce based on Hugo using templates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/hugo-ecommerce-collection/) guide.
