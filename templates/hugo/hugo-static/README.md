# Hugo Boilerplate

With the **Hugo Boilerplate**, you can start a project using the Hugo framework and deploy it to the edge in a few steps. The template creates a GitHub repository containing your project, as well as an edge application and a domain to facilitate your access and management through Azion Edge Platform.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go. It allows users to create websites from plain text files using various markup formats, using a simple templating system that enables you to customize the look and feel of your site. It supports content management, multilingual sites, and various content types, being ideal for blogs, landing pages, documentation sites, portfolios, and more.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the Hugo Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/hugo-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Hugo version `0.119.0`.
